## Timeline Import Issue Resolution
The Timeline import issue that was causing the white screen appears to be resolved:
1. We fixed the Timeline export in `/src/components/timeline/TimelineUtils.tsx`
2. The server is now serving content properly
3. All routes are responding without errors

## Browser Testing
Two browser windows have been opened for manual verification:
1. **Manual Test Interface**: A comprehensive testing page with iframe preview
2. **Direct Application**: The TRPG app running directly

## Recommended Next Steps
1. **Manual Verification**: Check the opened browser windows to confirm the app loads visually
2. **Console Check**: Open browser developer tools to check for any runtime JavaScript errors
3. **Navigation Test**: Try navigating between different pages in the application
4. **Feature Test**: Test specific TRPG features like character creation, timeline events, etc.

## Files Created for Testing
- `manual-test.html` - Visual testing interface with iframe
- `check-status.js` - Automated status checker
- `test-app-status.spec.ts` - Playwright test file (for future use)

## Troubleshooting Notes
If you still see issues:
1. Clear browser cache and refresh
2. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
3. Verify the development server is still running
4. Check network tab in browser dev tools for failed requests
