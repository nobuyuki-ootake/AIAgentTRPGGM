# üé≤ TRPG E2E Testing Framework - Implementation Summary

## üìã What Was Implemented

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive E2E testing framework specifically designed for the TRPG (Tabletop Role-Playing Game) application. This framework provides extensive coverage of all major TRPG workflows and scenarios.

## üèóÔ∏è Framework Architecture

### 1. Enhanced Playwright Configuration (`playwright.config.ts`)

- **TRPG-optimized settings**: Extended timeouts, enhanced screenshots, comprehensive tracing
- **Multiple test projects**: Desktop, session, performance, mobile, and accessibility testing
- **Global setup/teardown**: Automated environment preparation and cleanup
- **Advanced reporting**: HTML, JSON, JUnit, and custom TRPG reports

### 2. Test Organization Structure

```
e2e/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ trpg-core/              # Core TRPG functionality
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ trpg-session/           # Session management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ performance/            # Performance benchmarking
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ mobile/                 # Mobile experience
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ accessibility/          # WCAG compliance
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/                  # Shared utilities
```
